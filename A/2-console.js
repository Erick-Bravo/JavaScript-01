/*
Here, we will show you how to debug your code using console.log();
To do this, we need to make our terminal show us what our files 
are outputting.
Debugging is arguably the most relavent in terms of what programmers have
to do to help our clients fancy website to run smooth. We debug, and we debug often.
There are many ways to debug, but using javascripts console.log to
see what our code is doing is the most basic (and probably the most used)
*/ 

//Here are our logs

console.log("Hi there!");
console.log("Look, I'm a programmer!");

//Now, we can only see a single file's output at a time so,
//In the terminal run: node A/2-console.js
//See that the terminal outputs what is in our logs above
//To get more familiar with paths in the terminal, I want you to go back
//in there and ask the terminal if it can find the folder and file for you
//by using the "tab" button. (steps below) 

//Go to your terminal and enter the command: ls
//If you havent guessed yet, this is your file structure at the current level.
//Now, lets ask node to finish some of the typing for us.
//Note: (*tab = press the tab button)
//In the terminal, type: node A
//Well, that what a little too easy. That folder is only 1 letter.
//At least, it added our '/' for use
//Let's try again and go deeper. 
//Now, add the number 2 and *tab again. It should finish out the rest of the file name.
//I encourage you to use this feature to reach a file anytime. 

//Now, Id like you to write at least 5 logs with whatever your heart desires.
//This is for muscle memory.
//They can be numbers, or a message in quotes like what we have above.
//Then run the command again to see your output.



//^^write at least 5 logs above this line;
