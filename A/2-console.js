/*
Here, we will show you how to debug your code using console.log();
To do this, we need to make our terminal show us what our files 
are outputting.
Debugging very relavent in terms of what programmers have
to do to help our clients fancy website run smoothly. We debug, and we debug often.
There are many ways to debug, but using javascripts console.log to
see what our code is doing is the most basic (and probably the most used)
*/ 

//Here are our logs

console.log("Hi there!");
console.log("Look, I'm a programmer!");

/*
Now, we can only see a single file's output at a time so,
In the terminal run: node A/2-console.js
See that the terminal outputs what is in our logs above.
To get more familiar with paths in the terminal, I want you to go back
in there and ask the terminal if it can find the folder and file for you
by using the "tab" button. (steps below) 

Go to your terminal and enter the command: ls
Look at the output.
If you havent guessed yet, this is your file structure at the current level.
Now, lets ask node to finish some of the typing for us.
Note: (*tab = press the tab button)
In the terminal, type: node A *tab
Well, that what a little too easy. That folder is only 1 letter.
At least, it added our '/' for us
Let's try again and go deeper. 
Now, add the number 2 and *tab again. 
It should finish out the rest of the file name.
I encourage you to use this feature to reach a file anytime. 
And remember once you use a command, 
you can hit the up or down errors to check your recently used commands.

Now, Id like you to write at least 5 logs with whatever your heart desires.
This is for muscle memory.
They can be numbers, or a message in quotes like what we have above.
Then run the command again to see your output.


*/


console.log("Programming is actually really fun");
console.log("and it pays too.");



//^^write at least 5 additional logs above this line


/*
-----Semi-Colons ; ----
Note: Let's talk about semi-colons really quick ";"
You will see them at the end of code.
You will be happy to know that code does not need these to run anymore.
But I still encourage you to write them.
Essentially, all professionals still use them even though they do not do anything
besides allowing a programmer to know the end of code.
It's been beaten in me, so I keep using them.
