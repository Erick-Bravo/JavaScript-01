<h1>Nice!</h1>

(Remember ...this is an md file.)

Congrats on completing the first step in learning Programming with Javascript. We talked about a lot, and in the next learning we will talk about even more. For now, let's review what we have discussed. </br>

<h2>Review</h2>

- terminal
- console.log
- variables
- functions
- arguments
- strings vs numbers
- interpolated strings

</br>
</br>
<h3>The Terminal</h3>

The terminal is a powerful tool that you have yet to fully uncover. But now, at least, you know how to ask node to run a specific file. You may have also seen some errors along the way. The terminal is also where we read these errors to figure out what we can fix.</br>


<h3>Console.log</h3>

You got familiar with how to dubug your own code using console.log to log variable and the outputs of functions. It probably should be called terminal.log ...but we won't talk about that now.</br>

<h3>Variables</h3>

Variables are simply a name with a value assigned to it. 
</br>

<h3>Functions</h3>

A functions is essentially logic in a closed off container. 
They can be very simple or extremely complex.
</br>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
Arguments are variables that are passed into a function, which are then used by the function in some way.
They can be given any name inside the parenthesis just like variables.
</br>
</br>
<h3>Strings vs Numbers</h3>

Strings are text or number in quotoations.
Numbers are just numbers
5 does not equate to "5" in code logic
</br>

<h3>Interpolated Strings</h3>

Interpolated string are still strings but dynmaic.
Using backticks and ${ }, you can toss values inside a message to display data inside that message.
</br>

<h2>Test</h2>

Now you can go over to folder B and take your first test! </br>
Try your best not to look in folder A.
Only look when you are completely stuck.
Good Luck.
