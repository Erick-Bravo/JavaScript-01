//Function with Arguments

//Here you will write fuctions with arguments
//Its like the last interpolatetion problem but backwards and writing annoying strings.
//For the first four problems, you will just write in the arguments in the proper order
//Then, you will write out the function completely.



//Problem 1
//Write in the appropriate arguments inside the interpolated string 
//return "I think i'm tired of these stupid strings"

const functionWithArgs = (arg1, arg2, arg3) => {
    return `I think i'm ${arg2} of these ${arg3} ${arg1}`;
};

functionWithArgs("strings", "tired", "stupid");


//Problem 2
//Same as above
//Modify the return so is looks like this: return bigger number > smaller number

const functionWithArgsTwo = (num1, num2) => {
    return num2 > num1;
};

functionWithArgsTwo(5, 24)

//return 
//Problem 3
//Problem 4
//Problem 5
//Problem 6
