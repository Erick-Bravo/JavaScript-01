//Exam
//If you have not gone through the "Learning" folder, you are not ready for this.

//Try your hardest not to look at the Learning material.
//Only look when completely stuck.
//Use that noodle.

//If you'd like, call the functions in a log to see what they are outputting.

//One more thing
//When you are ready to test this file, uncomment the module.exports below. 
//However, If you have not created all the functions yet, or
//there is an unassigned variable (and the module.exports
//are uncommented while you try to see your logs), the terminal will throw
// an error. This is because it freaks out when it cant find the functions to export.






//Problem 1
//Write a function called sayHello and return a string of "Hello".





//Problem 2
//Write a function called sayHelloTwo and return "Hello again, Mr. Bojangles"









//module.exports section
//As mentioned above, you will need to uncomment the below in order to pass the tests
// If you don't remember how to do that, 
// Highlight the module.exports and hit command + / (PC: windows + /)
// If you accidentally delete it, command + z (PC: windows + z) or re-write it.

// module.exports = {
//     sayHello,
//     sayHelloTwo
// };
