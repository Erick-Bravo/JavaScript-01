/*Here, we will show you how to debug your code using console.log();
To do this, we need to make our terminal show us what our files 
are outputting.
Debugging is arguably the most relavent in terms of what programmers have
to do to help create fancy programs for our clients. We debug often.
There are many ways to debug, but using javascripts console.log to
see what our code is doing is the most basic (and probably the most used)
*/ 

//Here are our logs

console.log("Hi there!");
console.log("Look, I'm a programmer!");

//Now, we can only see a single file output at a time so,
//In the terminal run: node Learning/2-console.js
//See that the terminal outputs what was in our logs
//To get more familiar with paths in the terminal, I want you to go back
//in there and ask the terminal if it can find the folder and file for you
//by using the "tab" button. (steps below)
//While you do this, please look to the file structure on your left
// and see if you can understand what is going on here. 

//Go to your terminal and type: node i 'tab'
//If you hit the 'tab' button after you typed node i, it should 
//finish the rest for you. It should now be: node Learning/
//Now, add the number 2 and hit tab again. It should finish out the rest of the file name.
//I encourage you to use this feature to reach a file anytime. 

//Now, Id like you to write at least 10 logs with whatever your heart desires.
//This is for muscle memory.
//They can be numbers, or a message in quotes like what we have above.
//Then run the command again to see your output.



//^^write at least 10 logs above this line;
