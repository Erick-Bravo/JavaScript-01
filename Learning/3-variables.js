//Variables

//You will now learn about variables and how to write them
//Variables are very easy to understand
//You pick a name that is well suited for the context, and give it a value.

//Here are 3 different ways to write variables

var randomVariable1 = "I am the var variable, everyone hates me";
let randomVariable2 = 10;
const randomVariable3 = "I am the const variable, everyone loves me";

console.log(randomVariable1);
console.log(randomVariable2);
console.log(randomVariable3);

//tell node to run this file
//Meaning, go into your terminal and run that command like before
//Hint: this time its: node intro/3-variables.js
//Understand how to do this now? I am going to assume yes from now on. 

//You should see the terminal output the values of those variables

//Essentially, 'var' and 'let' work the same but no one really uses var anymore.
//You will only be using 'let' and 'const'.
//You will also see the difference between the two soon. 
//but for now, write some creative variables with equally creative 
//values of your own below!
//and don't forget you need to log them to be able to see the output!

//Note: Notice how the variables are written? first letter is lowercase and
//the first letter of the next word is capital. This is called "camel-case"
//Is the the "naming-convention" of JavaScript. "Naming-convention" meaning,
//it doesnt really matter, BUT everyone in the JavaScript community long ago
//has decided this is how variables will be written. So, it is what it is.
