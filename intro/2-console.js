/*Here, we will show you how to debug your code using console.log();
To do this, we need to make our terminal show us what our files 
are outputting.
Debugging it arguably the most relavent in terms of what programmers have
to know to create fancy programs for our clients. We debug often.
There are many many ways to debug, but using javascripts console.log to
see what our code is doing is the most basic (and probably the most used)
*/ 

// First, uncomment the console.logs
// click on each console.log and use: command + /
// for PC: window key + /

// console.log("Hi there!");
// console.log("Look, I'm a programmer!")

//Now, In the terminal run: node intro/2-console.js
//See that the terminal outputted what was in the console.logs
//To get more familiar with paths in the terminal, I want you to go back
//in there and ask the terminal if it knows what file you are reffering to
//by using the "tab" button.
//While you do this, please look to the file structure on your left
// and see if you can understand what is going on here. 

//Go to your terminal and type: node i 'tab'
//If you hit the 'tab' button after you typed node i, it should 
//finish the rest for you. It should now be: node intro/
//Now, add the number 2 and hit tab again. It should finish out the rest.
//I encourage you to use this feature while searching through file structures. 

//Now, Id liek you to write at least 10 console.logs with whatever your heart desires.
//They can be numbers, or a message like what we did.
//Then run the command again, to see your output.


//^^write at least 10 console.logs;
