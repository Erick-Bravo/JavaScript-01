//Note: Have you noticed the semi-colons ";" at the end of every variable and function?;
//Once upon a time in JavaScript, you needed these to run your code. 
//Now you just need them so your tech lead doesn't yell at you. 
//Don't take my word for it, verify that it works with both semi-colon and without. 
//It's more formatting than anything now. (with JavaScript)
//I encourage you to still use them, as it is actually frowned upon if you don't.
