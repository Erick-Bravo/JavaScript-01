//You will now learn about variables and how to write them
//Variables are very easy to understand
//You pick a name that is well suited for the context, and give it a value.

//Here are 3 different ways to write variables

var randomVariable1 = "I am the var variable";
let randomVariable2 = 10;
const randomVariable3 = "I am the const variable";

console.log(randomVariable1);
console.log(randomVariable2);
console.log(randomVariable3);

//tell node to run this file
//Meaning, go into your terminal and run that command like before
//Hint: this time its: node intro/3-variables.js
//Understand how to do this now? I am going to assume yes from now on. 

//You should see the terminal output the values of those variables

//Essentially, var and let work the same but no one really uses var anymore
//You will only be using let and const.
//You will also see the difference between the two in the future. 
//but for now, write some variables of your own below!
//and don't forget you need to log them to be able to see the output!
