Hello!

Welcome, and congrats on your new journey in an effort to help you
get a grapsp on this future thang! 
(aka, what is happening today here and now)

We have a lot to discuss, but I hope, at the very least, I can help you understand how 
programming works at the most basic level possible. 

Then, when you feel ready, you can move onto the more difficult folders.

It is absolutely vital to know that it is not only important to write code, but also understand 
what is happening under the hood. So, I hope to explain things as thoroughy as possible and if you
have any questions, please, do not hesistate to ask me ...or google.

Note: Frustration is all part of the journey. Getting stuck happens to programmers of ALL levels.
With that said, you will get stuck. There will be things that go over your head. There will be walls 
that make feel really tiny and hopeless in ever getting over. BUT, when you do get over that wall,
I can assure you, the feeling is the exact reason why programmers stay in their industries to keep
trucking along ...oh yeah, and great pay helps too.

Happy hacking...
