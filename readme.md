<h2>Hello!</h2>

Welcome, and congrats on your new journey in an effort to help you
get a grasp on this future thang! <br />
(aka, what is happening today here/now and will forever be)

We have a lot to discuss, but I hope, at the very least, I can help you to write some JavaScript at the most basic level possible. 

Then, when you feel ready, you can move onto the more difficult JavaScript problems. <br />
(Links to these folders will be added over time at the bottom of this markdown file.)

It is absolutely vital to know that it is not only important to write code, but also understand 
how our code is working. Now, we donâ€™t necessarily need to try and understand what is happening "under the hood" of JavaScript working behind the scenes, but the goal here is to understand how OUR code works and how it can be used to do some really neat stuff. The code you write matters! So, I hope to explain things as thoroughy as possible and if you
have any questions, please, do not hesistate to ask me ...or google.

Note: Frustration is all part of the journey. Getting stuck happens to programmers of ALL levels.
For example, I got stuck plenty of times trying to get these darn tests to work properly.
With that said, you will get stuck. There will be things that go over your head. There will be walls 
that make you feel really tiny and hopeless in ever getting over them. BUT, when you do get over those walls,
I can assure you, the feeling is the exact reason why programmers stay in their industries to keep
trucking along. You will also see yourself over time become undeniably better, which is an AMAZING feeling. <br />
...oh yeah, and great pay helps too.

<h3>Happy hacking... </h3>
