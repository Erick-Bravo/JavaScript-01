Now that you are more familiar with debugging your code and writing functions,
we will be going through much more concepts on the next lesson. This past lesson was the toolbelt, and on the next one you will be handed some solid and much needed tools.
We will be diving much deeper. </br>

Here are some of the topics you will be learning:
- `"If" statements` (Do something specific when a condition is met)
- `"For" loops` (Do something for a specific amount of times)
- Storage types
    - `Arrays`
    - `Objects`



This doesn't seem like a lot, but they are crucial to understand to even further unlock what we can do with functions. Additionally, there are plenty subtopics under these topics. Start `Programming-02` when you are ready (...or when I finish writing it)
