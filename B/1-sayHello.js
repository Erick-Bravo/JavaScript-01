Exam

READY?
Try your hardest to not look at the A material.
Only look when completely stuck.
Use that noodle.

Reminder: you can call the functions in a log to see what you are outputting.

One more thing
You will be running the command 'npm run test' to test out your work. Not node.
BUT, you will first need to uncomment the "module.exports" code at the very bottom of this file.
* Write your functions first, THEN uncomment out the code to run your tests. * 
If for any reason you try the command 'npm run test' and have not created the functions, 
the terminal will throw an error.
This is because it freaks out if the functions are not created.
The bottom "module.exports" are commented out so you can consol.log your outputs as you go in this file.
This is the only time you will need to do this, promise. 

Good luck on your first test!
*/



//Problem 1
//Write a function called sayHello and return a string of "Hello".




//Problem 2
//Write a function called sayHelloTwo and return "Hello again, Mr. Bojangles"




//Problem 3
//Write a function called returnNumber and return any number greater than 0, as a number.




/*
As mentioned above, you will need to uncomment the below in order to pass the tests
Only uncomment when all your functions are created
If you don't remember how to do that, 
Highlight everything below and hit command + / (PC: ctrl + /)
If you accidentally delete it, command + z (PC: ctrl + z) or re-write it. I believe in you.
*/


// module.exports = {
//     sayHello,
//     sayHelloTwo,
//     returnNumber
// };
