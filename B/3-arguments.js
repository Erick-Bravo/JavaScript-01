/*
Function with Arguments

For the first three problems, you will just write in the arguments into the returns
Its like the last interpolatetion problem but backwards.
Then, you will write out the function completely.
*/


//Problem 1
//Modify the return so is looks like this: return bigger number > smaller number
// smaller numner < bigger number will also work, it just needs to be a true statement

const functionWithArgs = (num1, num2) => {
    return ;
};

console.log(functionWithArgs(5, 24));





//return 
//Problem 3


//Problem 4
//Problem 5
//Problem 6


module.exports = {
    functionWithArgs,
    functionWithArgsTwo
}
